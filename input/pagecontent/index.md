### Background

In 2022, the White House reignited the Cancer Moonshot, setting an ambitious, achievable goal: to reduce the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years, and improve the experience of people and families living with and surviving cancer, ultimately ending cancer as we know it today. 

The Cancer Moonshot has spurred tremendous action across the federal government and from the public and private sectors, building a strong foundation for the work ahead. Today, the Administration is announcing new actions from inside and outside of government that will drive additional progress, drawing us closer to ending cancer as we know it today.

### mCODE [[2]](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/CCI.20.00059)

mCODE™ (short for Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) is an initiative intended to assemble a core set of structured data elements for oncology electronic health records (EHRs). mCODE is a step towards capturing research-quality data from the treatment of all cancer patients. This would enable the treatment of every cancer patient to contribute to comparative effectiveness analysis of cancer treatments by allowing for easier methods of data exchange between health systems.

mCODE serves as the core standard for the current IG.

### CC-Direct

National Cancer Institute (NCI) is launching a first-of-its-kind, public-private partnership to bring clinical and patient navigation support to families facing childhood cancer. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is launching the Childhood Cancer – Data Integration for Research, Education, Care, and Clinical Trials (CC-DIRECT) to support children and Adolescents and Young Adults (AYAs) with cancer throughout their cancer journey; provide patient navigation support to families seeking information and optimal care; facilitate research participation; and establish a portable, shareable, standardized cancer health record. This means families facing childhood cancer can reach out for support and get connected to excellent care and the opportunity to participate in research through clinical trials and data sharing initiatives. This new entity represents a groundbreaking collaboration between NCI, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (ACTO), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Cancer Society (ACS), the MITRE Corporation, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Children’s Oncology Group (COG), and the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).

### Pediatric Cancer Data Commons [[4]](https://commons.cri.uchicago.edu/pcdc/)

Consistent data standards are the foundation for usable, high-quality data. We work with pediatric cancer experts and the National Cancer Institute to develop consensus-based data dictionaries and map all clinical data in the PCDC to standardized terms.

The PCDC data dictionaries are available [here](https://commons.cri.uchicago.edu/data-dictionaries/).

The initial targets of this project are osteosarcoma (OS) and leukemia (LK); in particular, capturing the [PCDC](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15g8aOtaZ9DS7-mBO42AR18g0ScqlPHkalOiV457ddoU/edit#gid=249286314) in FHIR.
